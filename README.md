# About me

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Bryce Blignaut
#### Data Science Student at Brigham Young University - Idaho
##### [Resume](https://github.com/BryceBlignaut/BryceBlignaut/blob/main/Resume_updated%202022.pdf)
##### About Me
Driven data professional with proven skills in SQL, Python, R, Tableau and Power BI. My career interests have turned from IT consulting and infrastructure to data science. I'm on a journey to make sense of information and provide insights to business professionals and companies. 

I'm seeking entry level data positions where I can leverage ML to do cool things. 

**Achievements**
- Developed real time BI reports which improved the company's CRM system by 42%
- Managed 20+ Domo BI dashboards
- Created ETLs to wrangle and change data
- Project managed the integration of two service management systems, helped over 4000 users receive timely resolution of IT tickets, and decreased customer complaints by 80%

My previous consulting experience in IT Service Management and process creation with one of the largest financial services providers in Africa has taught me to be highly adaptable. I worked on projects that implemented solutions which impacted 4000+ users and administrators. I spearhead, take ownership and make an impact on every team I join.

I've joined the data science society, become a student mentor, and volunteered for a two year humanitarian and ecclesiastical mission. These experiences have taught me what it means to be a leader and to work towards a better environment and uplift the people around you.
